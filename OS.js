// The OS module provides various functions for interacting with the operating system. It can access information such as the platform, architecture, and version of the operating system. This is helpful for making platform-specific decisions, such as which version of a library to use, and optimizing code for different environments. It can also provide methods for working paths, the file system, and managing system resources. 

// Including the OS module in the program.
const os = require('os');

// Printing the platform, architecture, and version of the operating system.
console.log("Platform: " + os.platform());
console.log("Architecture: " + os.arch());
console.log("Version: " + os.version());

// Printing the constants of the OS module (a very long list!).
// console.log(os.constants);

// Printing the total memory and free memory of the OS.
console.log("Total Memory: " + os.totalmem());
console.log("Free Memory: " + os.freemem());

// Printing the type, uptime (in seconds), and user info of the OS.
console.log("Type: " + os.type());
console.log("Uptime: " + os.uptime());
console.log("User Info:");
console.log(os.userInfo());
